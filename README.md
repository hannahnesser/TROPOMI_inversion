# A high-resolution inversion of 2019 TROPOMI methane observations over North America

This repository includes the code necessary to recreate an inversion of 2019
TROPOMI observations over North America.

## Inversion procedure
1. Run generate_clusters.py

   **Description**

   This script generates a cluster file that meets HEMCO requirements for use in inversions. The file maps a unique integer key for every grid cell contained in the state vector to the latitude-longitude grid used in the forward model. A grid cell is included in the state vector if it meets either the `emis_threshold` or `land_threshold` criteria.

   **Inputs**

   | Input             | Description                                        |
   | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | emis_file | A file or files containing information on methane emissions from the prior run. This is typically given by HEMCO_diagnostics. The input here can be either a list of monthly files or a single file with an annual average. |
   | land_file | A file containing information on land cover for inversion domain. This can be provided by the land cover file referenced by HEMCO_Config.rc. |
   | emis_threshold | An emission threshold in Mg/km2/yr that gives the minimum anthropogenic emissions needed in a grid cell for its inclusion in the cluster file. The default value is 0.1. |
   | land_threshold | A fractional land threshold that gives the minimum fraction of a grid cell that must be land covered for inclusion in the cluster file. The default value is 0.25. |

   **Outputs**

   | Output            | Description                                        |
   | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | clusters.nc | A HEMCO-ready cluster file that maps a unique key for every grid cell contained in the state vector to the latitude-longitude grid used in the forward model. |
   | clusters.png | A plot of the clusters. |

   To do:
   - [ ] Move inputs to one directory
   - [x] Change hardcoded cluster file name

2. Run generate_prior.py

   **Description**

   This script generates netcdfs of the absolute and relative prior emissions and error variances for use in an analytical inversion.

   **Inputs**

   | Input             | Description                                        |
   | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | emis_file | A file or files containing information on methane  emissions from the prior run. This is typically given by HEMCO_diagnostics. The input here can be either a list of monthly files or a single file with an annual average. |
   | clusters | The cluster file generated by generate_clusters.py that maps a unique key for every grid cell contained in the state vector to the latitude - longitude grid used in the forward model. |
   | rel_err | The relative error (standard deviation) value to be used in the relative prior error covariance matrix. The default is 0.5. |

   **Outputs**

   | Output            | Description                                        |
   | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | xa.nc | A netcdf containing the relative prior (all ones) xa. |
   | sa.nc | A netcdf containing the relative prior error (all given by rel_err). |
   | xa_abs.nc | A netcdf containing the absolute prior. |
   | sa_abs.nc | A netcdf containing the absolute prior error. |

   To do:
   - [ ] Move inputs to one directory

3. Run generate_obs.py
   I

## To do
- [ ] Rewrite to_dataset() (in inversion.py) to automatically identify elements of object
- [ ] Regenerate
- [ ] Move all inputs for inversion to one directory to allow for consistency across
      various scripts
- [ ] Add great lakes to plotting
- [ ] Fix doc strings at the top of every python file -- read me would be a good source for these
- [ ] Change all scripts to allow iterating through other years
