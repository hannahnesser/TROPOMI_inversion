This file contains instructions for setting up GEOS-Chem run directories for use
in methane analytical inversions (mps, 2/20/2020)

===============================================================================
Setting up code and run directories:
===============================================================================

1. Open setup_ch4_inversion.sh in a text editor and modify the following:

   Setup settings
   ---------------------
   SetupTemplateRundir : Copy run directory files from GEOS-Chem and
                         replace text in input files according to settings in
                         setup_ch4_inversion.sh. The template run directory is
                         needed to set up the spinup, Jacobian, and posterior
                         run directories. It only needs to be generated once.
   SetupSpinupRun      : Create a run directory to spinup a new restart file
                         representative of your model setup.
   SetupJacobianRunDirectories : Setup run directories for each of your
                         perturbation clusters. The output from these
                         simulations will be used to construct the Jacobian.
   SetupInversion      : Copy scripts used to post-process GEOS-Chem data,
                         build the Jacobian, and run the inversion.
   SetupPosteriorRun:  : Create a run directory to submit a posterior run.
   
   File paths
   ------------
   RUN_NAME : Specify a name for your simulations.
   MY_PATH  : Set it to the file path where you want to setup the CH4 inversion
              run directories. It is recommended you put this in $SCRATCH but
	      be aware of the 90-day retention applied to that space.
   DATA_PATH: Path to non-emissions data that will replate {DATA_ROOT} token
              in input.geos and HEMCO_Config.rc. The default is path is
	      /n/holyscratch01/external_repos/GEOS-CHEM/gcgrid/gcdata/ExtData.
	      The emissions data path is set in HEMCO_Config.rc and by default
	      is set to /n/jacob_lab/Lab/seasasfs02/CH4_Inversion/HEMCO.
   RESTART_FILE: Path to the initial restart file. Sample restart files may be
                 found in /n/jacob_lab/Lab/seasasfs02/CH4_inversion/InputData/Restarts.
   BC_FILES: Path to boundary condition files to be used for nested grid
             simulations. This will replace the file path in HEMCO_Config.rc.

   Simulation settings
   ---------------------
   DO_SPINUP   : Set to true to run a spinup simulation to generate a new
                 restart file representative of your model setup.
   SPINUP_START: Start date of your spinup period in YYYYMMDD format.
   SPINUP_END  : End   date of your spinup period in YYYYMMDD format.
   START_DATE  : Start date of your production runs in YYYYMMDD format.
   END_DATE    : End   date of your production runs in YYYYMMDD format.

   Grid settings
   ---------------
   RES      : Options are "4x5", "2x2.5", "0.5x0.625", and "0.25x0.3125".
   MET      : Options are "merra2" or "geosfp".
   LONS     : Enter the min and max longitude edges of your domain.
              e.g. For global      simulations use "-180.0 180.0"
	           For nested NA   simulations use "-140.0 -40.0" (0.5x0.625)
		                                   "-130.0 -60.0" (0.25x0.3125)
		   For nested Asia simulations use "  60.0 150.0" (0.5x0.625)
		                                   "  70.0 140.0" (0.25x0.3125)
   LATS     : Enter the min and max latitude edges of your domain.
              e.g. For global      simulations use "-90.0 90.0"
	           For nested NA   simulations use " 10.0 70.0" (0.5x0.625)
		                                   " 9.75 60.0" (0.25x0.3125)
		   For nested Asia simulations use " 15.0 55.0" (0.5x0.625)
		                                   "-11.0 55.0" (0.25x0.3125)
   HPOLAR   : Set to "T" for global simulations to use half polar boxes. Set to
              "F" for nested grid simulations.
   LEVS     : Set to 47 to use the reduced 47-level grid recommended for CH4
              simulations.
   NEST     : Set to "F" for global simulations or "T" for nested simulations.
   REGION   : Set to "" for global or "NA", "AS", "CH", "EU" for default domains
   BUFFER   : Set to "0 0 0 0" for global simulations. For nested simulations,
              the recommendation is to use "3 3 3 3" to use 3 grid cells along
	      the nested-grid domain for your buffer zone.

   Jacobian settings
   -------------------
   nClusters : Number of clusters to include in constructing your Jacobian. This
               will be equal to the number of GEOS-Chem runs - 1. Set this value
	       to 0 to run the prior simulation with no perturbations applied.
   pPERT    : Perturbation value to apply to clusters in analytical inversion.
              "CH4_Jacobian"

   Additional settings (change options in input.geos)
   ---------------------
   GOSAT    : Set to true to use GOSAT observation operator.
   TCCON    : Set to true to use TCCON observation operator.
   UseEmisSF: Set to true to use emission scale factors from a previous
              analytical inversion.
   UseSeparateWetlandsSF: Set to true to use separate scale factors for
              wetland and nonwetland emissions.
   UseOHSF  : Set to true to use OH scale factors from a previous analytical
              inversion.
   PLANEFLIGHT: Set to true to use the planeflight diagnostic.
   HourlyCH4: Set to true to save out hourly CH4 concentrations and pressure
              edges


2. Save and close setup_ch4_inversion.sh.

3. Load your fortran compiler if you haven't already. You may use the
   init scripts found in the ACMG env repository. For example:

      # Clone ACMG startup scripts if you haven't already
      cd ~
      git clone https://bitbucket.org/gcst/env.git

      # Load ifort17 compiler and companion modules
      source ~/env/envs/gcc_cmake.ifort17_openmpi_cannon.env

   NOTE: If you change terminal windows or open a new session on Cannon, you
         will need to resource the same file to run your simulations.

4. Navigate back to the directory containing setup_ch4_inversion.sh and type:

      ./setup_ch4_inversion.sh

5. Navigate to ${MY_PATH}/${RUN_NAME} as as specified in setup_ch4_inversion.sh.

5. If you set DO_SPINUP to true, submit the spinup simulation.

   5a. Navigate into the spinup_run directory.

   5b. Open ${RUN_NAME}_Spinup.run and modify the #SBATCH commands at the top
       as needed. See https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/running-jobs/ for
       details.

   5c. Submit the spinup run to the SLURM scheduler using:
          sbatch ${RUN_NAME}_Spinup.run

6. Submit the Jacobian runs.

   6a. Navigate into the jacobian_runs directory

   6b. If running just the base simulation (run #0000, e.g. for prior or
       posterior), you can submit your run using the RUN_NAME_0000.run script
       in your run_dirs/RUN_NAME_0000 run directory. You will first need to
       uncomment the #SBATCH lines in that file and make any necessary changes
       to those options in order to submit to the queue. Then, at the command
       line, type "sbatch RUN_NAME_0000.run" at the command line (replacing
       RUN_NAME with the string you defined in setup_ch4_inversion.sh.

   6c. If running the full set of runs to construct the Jacobian, open and
       modify run_dirs/run_jacobian_simulations.sh to use the desired #SBATCH
       options. Then submit the array of jobs for all perturbation
       runs by typing "./submit_jacobian_simulations_array.sh".

7. Run the inversion.

   7a. Navigate into the inversion directory

   7b. Open run_inversion.sh in a text editor and modify the SBATCH settings
       as necessary.

   7c. Load your python environment.

   7d. Type "./run_inversion.sh" at the command line.
   
===============================================================================
Making changes to your code and run directory
===============================================================================

Modify your local copy of GEOS-Chem source code and the run directories files
within for any special options or new science that you want to include
for your research. If your changes are mature and/or will be useful for the
larger group, then they can be pulled into the standard repositories currently 
stored in /n/jacob_lab/Lab/seasasfs02/CH4_Inversion (contact Melissa for help).

   - To add new options in input.geos:
     1. Modify the input.geos files in the CH4 run directories.
     2. Add logical fields to Input_Opt for your new switches. These can
        be added in GEOS-Chem/Headers/input_opt_mod.F90. Make sure to both
	define and initialize the fields (see other CH4 options for examples).
     3. Add code to read the new lines in in subroutine READ_CH4_MENU (found in
        GEOS-Chem/GeosCore/input_mod.F). Also add code to print out the
	value of those options at the end of that subroutine.
     4. Modify the areas of code where this new option will impact and surround
        with "IF ( Input_Opt%NewOption ) THEN ... ENDIF". This is generally
        done in global_ch4_mod.F.

   - To change emissions, cluster files, scale factor files or other input
     files used in your simulations:
     1. Modify the HEMCO configuration files in
        GEOS-Chem/runs/GCClassic/HEMCO_Config.rc.templates/. Add or modify the
	entry for your new file, changing the file path, variable name, dates,
	etc. as needed.
     2. If you modify an emissions file, HEMCO should handle it automatically,
        but if you add or modify cluster files, scale factor files, etc. then
	you will need to modify or add code in global_ch4_mod.F:
	 a. If necessary, add a new pointer at the top of the module (before
	    the line "CONTAINS") for your new field.
         b. Add/modify code to CALL Hco_GetPtr to ensure it points to the right
	    field name. This should match the name provided in HEMCO_Config.rc.
	 c. In appropriate area of the code (e.g. subroutine EMISSCH4 or
	    CHEMCH4), add code to utilize the new/modified field.
	 **As always, look at the existing code for other cluster files, scale
	   factors, etc. for examples on how to set up or modify your code.**

Set up a new set of run directories using your updates. Open your copy of
setup_ch4_inversion.sh in a text editor. Modify the RUN_NAME (to avoid
overwriting past runs) and any other input fields. Then execute
"./setup_ch4_inversion.sh".
